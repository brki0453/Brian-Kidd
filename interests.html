			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p>When I'm not doing school work there are a multitude of activities that I enjoy doing. I am on an intermural frisbee team at CU and if the weather permits it, throwing the disc is always an option.  Another great activity in Boulder is going on a beautiful hike, or even climbing up one of the Flat Irons. I also love going up to the mountains during the winter and go snowboarding. Also, ever since I was in fifth grade my family and I have gone rafting every summer.  The most recent rafting trip was in Idaho on the Middle Fork and the Salmon river, and the summer before that we went on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon.</p>
